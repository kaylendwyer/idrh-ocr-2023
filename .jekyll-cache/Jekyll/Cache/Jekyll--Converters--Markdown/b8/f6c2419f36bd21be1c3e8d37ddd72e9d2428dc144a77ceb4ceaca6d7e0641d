<h3 id="download-files">Download files</h3>
<p>You will need to download some files for the Shell lesson.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download [files coming soon!] and move them to your Desktop.</li>
  <li>Unzip/extract the file. <strong>Let your instructor know if you need help with this step.</strong> You should end up with a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> on your Desktop.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="install-software">Install software</h3>
<p>If you do not already have the shell software installed, you will need to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell">download and install it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-new-shell">Open a new shell</h3>
<p>After installing the software</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal. If youâ€™re not sure how to open a terminal on your operating system, see the instructions below.</li>
  <li>In the terminal type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> then press the <strong>Return</strong> key. This step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="where-to-type-commands">Where to type commands</h4>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>
Computers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program installed. In this lesson, we encourage you to use an emulator included in <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell">Git for Windows</a>, which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git.</p>

<p>Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start menu.</p>

<p><strong>macOS</strong>
For a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash. For a Mac computer running macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh. Your default shell is available via the Terminal program within your Utilities folder.</p>

<p>To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Finder, select the Go menu, then select Utilities. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.</li>
  <li>Use the Mac â€˜Spotlightâ€™ computer search function. Search for: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Terminal</code> and press <strong>Return.</strong>
To check if your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo $SHELL</code> in your terminal window.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-tesseract">Installing Tesseract</h2>
<p>We will not install Tesseract for this workshop, but if you would like to use tesseract on your own machine, follow the <a href="https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/#compiling-and-installation">installation guidelines in the tesseract documentation.</a></p>

<p>If you do not have administrator rights to your computer, you will need to configure Tesseract specially to use it.</p>

<p>The OCR lessons use images in a <a href="https://github.com/kaylendwyer/idrh-ocr-2023/blob/main/OCR-images.zip">zipped file on the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
