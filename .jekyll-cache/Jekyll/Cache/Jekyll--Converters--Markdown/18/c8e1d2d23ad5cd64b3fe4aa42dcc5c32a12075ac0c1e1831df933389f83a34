<p>The real benefit to using Tesseract over other OCR tools is the speed and ease of processing batches of files.</p>

<p>Basic input:</p>

<p>From within the directory of files (in this case, .jpg files). For each .jpg:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Echo the name of the file (to keep track of what is being processed)</li>
  <li>Instruct tesseract to run on a page, generate an image output, and apply any parameters.</li>
  <li>complete the loop with ‚Äúdone‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Input:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for page in *.jpg
do 
    echo "$page"
    tesseract "$page" "$page-output" -l eng
done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Did it work? First check if the files have been created by listing everything in the folder:</p>

<p>Input:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should have a .txt file for every image file in the directory. The next step is to figure out if tesseract actually ran and wrote text to each file. Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> to check.</p>

<p>Input:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>head *.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output example:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>==&gt; 00000012.jpg-output.txt &lt;==

You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphati-
cally, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.
How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were
partners for I don‚Äôt know how many years. Scrooge

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley‚Äôs name.
There it stood, years afterwards, above the ware-

<p>If you are running OCR on batches of random images, separate text files are useful. However, if you have a single book, you probably want the full text bundled together.</p>

<p>We can combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> and an output redirect to combine the files.</p>

<p>Input:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat *.txt &gt; full-book-title.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If it has run correctly, there will not be any message. To check if the file has been written correctly, we can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code>.</p>
